NEW CONSOLE COMMANDS

Three OATMEAL cvars (drop_ammo, drop_health, and drop_armor), if activated,
will create a console command that allows players to drop game items.

	/ammo
	This command drops a small amount of ammunition for the weapon
	currently being held.  Only active if drop_ammo is set to "1".

	/health
	This command drops a 25 Health ball (at a cost of 25 Health).  Only
	active if drop_health is set to "1".

	/armor
	This command drops armor.  If the calling player has more than 50
	armor, than a yellow Armor is dropped (at a cost of 40 Armor);
	else, an Armor Shard (at a cost of 5 Armor) is dropped.  Only active
	if drop_armor is set to "1".
